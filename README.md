# Marching Cubes

This is an implementation of the marching cubes algorithm. Marching cubes is an algorithm to extract a mesh from a 3D scalar field. By giving a 3D scalar field (called volumetric data in this implementation) as an input, it will generate the mesh data for that shape in a custom format.
